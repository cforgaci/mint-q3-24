Social media data<br>from Facebook or X

## Why social media data?

In the digital media era, social media platforms and websites serve as valuable sources for collecting user-generated content, which in turn represents the voices and opinions of citizens. Twitter (X)'s real-time nature and vast array of tweets cover diverse topics, providing insights into current events, public reactions, and emerging trends. Similarly, Facebook's extensive user base and features like status updates and comments offer rich data on user experiences and interactions.

## What is web scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves automated techniques to collect information from web pages or social media website, typically in formats such as HTML, XML, or JSON. Web scraping allows you to retrieve specific data elements, such as text, images, or tables, from web pages and store them for analysis or other purposes.

Quantitative analysis:<br>Topic modeling

## Quantitative analysis

<b>Why?</b>:

-   Reproducible - re-run the analysis with the same results
-   Automated - run the analysis on other data
-   Scalable - run the analysis on (much) more data

<b>Good to know:</b>:

-   Requires (some) knowledge of statistics
-   Results depend on the amount and quality of data available

## The method

Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a method used to reveal latent topics in unstructured text data.

In an LDA model: 

- documents are a mixture of topics
- topics are a mixture of words
