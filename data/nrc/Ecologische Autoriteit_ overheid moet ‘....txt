nature areas, the Natura 2000 areas, are doing worse than when they were notified as worthy of protection years

Measures are "urgent" and should not be limited to the boundaries of the neglected natural

For this opinion, the advisory body reviewed 70 of the 130 analyses all
provinces have made of their natural areas. These so-called
nature goal analyses are "valuable" but in some cases incomplete,

the protected nature areas that cause the deterioration of nature within them.

 "This opinion confirms what we have known for a long time, namely that our nature is under
