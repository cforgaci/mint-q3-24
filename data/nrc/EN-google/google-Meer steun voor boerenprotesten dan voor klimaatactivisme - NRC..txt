More support for farmers' protests then
for climate activism

farmers' protest, can count on little sympathy.

 Kieskompas measures a difference between urban and non-urban residents
areas. For example, Zeelanders support farmer activism the most compared to
residents from other provinces, with about 50 percent, Climate activists can enter
Zeeland can count on the least support.
 Support for protests
Full or largely support per province (February 2024)
Climate protests Farmers' protests
There is also a strong similarity in support and party preference
participants, with by far the most support for farmers among FVD, PVV, BBB
 voters and for climate activists at Volt, GroenLinks-PvdA and PvdD.
Kieskompas also conducted research into which methods of protest are supported
received. This shows that when both climate activists and farmers
block a highway, they can count on significantly less sympathy than
when they demonstrate at government buildings or companies.
