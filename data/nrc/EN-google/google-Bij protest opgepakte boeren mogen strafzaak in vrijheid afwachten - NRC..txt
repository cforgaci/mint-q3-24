Tensions
The detention of the two farmers led to rising tensions in the country
region. The mayor of Apeldoorn, Ton Heerts, showed up on Wednesday evening
forced to declare an emergency order for the entire municipality. With that order
the police can take action against rioters, close roads, evacuate places
and ban gatherings. People who don't cooperate can become
arrested. The special order measure was deemed necessary because the
police determined through chat groups of farmers on social media channels that a
storming of the headquarters in Apeldoorn was planned. That
liberation action failed to materialize.
 Lawyer Pieter Pel from Hattem, who represents the 39-year-old suspected farmer, says that the
farmers have been released because they both have a busy dairy farm
run. “My client works seventy to eighty hours a week, as does his wife
has a job to keep his head above water. There is a whole
young company at risk if you keep this man any longer.”

Despite the busy work, I still found time on Monday evening
to block a highway. “The police do speak of coordinated actions, but...
my client was simply called up in an app group and didn't know where he was
got involved. It's not all that well-oiled.”
