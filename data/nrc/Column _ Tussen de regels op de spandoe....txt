but the implicit message I hear.
Growing up in Twente, not Enschede, there were
children of farmers at my elementary school; I was friends with some of them, I
came to their homes. Jumping ditches, catching tadpoles in a glass jar,
helping out on the farm... No, rather not that, because as a child I was afraid of the
most animals. Everyone found that perfectly understandable, because I spoke
High Dutch, and moreover, with my appearance I belonged to an
outside category. Not from here, but from there. The city, the west, or even further
away.
Viewed from the countryside, the relationship with the city is ambiguous: feelings of superiority
and feelings of inferiority constantly alternate. Urban people
 know nothing of real life, but also: beware of city people, because they
always outsmart you. Those people from the West should not think they are more
than us. They don't. The strange thing is that most city dwellers
hardly think back about the countryside.
In any case, the actions of farmers have put an end to that abuse: the
country revels in peasant rage.
Beneath it slumbers the idea that farmers are the backbone of the country, and
belong to the category of true, unquestioning Dutchmen. I have often
pondered the prima facie incomprehensible alliance between Baudet
and peasants, but in each case they share resentment. Those who grant themselves the
firstborn right, must get white hot when those privileges are
are tampered with.
The annoying thing is that there is no right of first birth to be granted in the Netherlands:
it is not a family, but a constitutional state, and the Dutch passport can
expire, but does not become worth more the longer it is in the family.
This misunderstanding must also be eliminated - as must the nitrogen.
