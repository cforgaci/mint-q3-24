to Hazeldonk: beer, sandwiches and burning
car tires

 Belgian measures
The parliament, explains action leader Jelle Pauwels, last week adopted a "nitrogen decree"
that is "based on erroneous and deliberately fabricated figures" and makes it "virtually impossible" for farmers
 to expand their businesses. Pauwels (39) lives in the Flemish village of Vlimmeren and runs
a contracting company. Pauwels: "Mathematical models are used that are known to have 70
percent deviation on them."

farmers have to get out of there."
 The action to block the border in three places at the same time is well coordinated, he says,
by the Flemish branch of the Dutch action group Farmers Defense Force (FDF), of which he is
vice president. Around midnight, he says, there were five hundred Flemish tractors on
the A16, with a thousand participating activists. People wanted to stay as long as possible.
Sleep-deprived farmers
Sympathy abounds for the Flemish farmers. Such as from Jan Donckers (68) from Flemish Meer, just
across the border. He climbed on his bike after seeing many swerve trucks early this morning on a narrow road where he
lives, saw a lot of swerve trucks. Donckers: "Industry is allowed to emit much more nitrogen
emissions than the farmers. That's not right. The port of Antwerp is everything to Flanders and the
farmers just have to sweat out the pain. That's wrong. There will have to be fewer emissions, but
not this way."
The leader of FDF in the Netherlands, Mark van den Oever, made his appearance on Friday just down the road,
at the blockade of the A67 highway in East Brabant. On the phone, he says that the farmers' actions in
abroad are "motivating" the Dutch. "Many farmers here are a bit asleep
dormant, but we are going to do more action again." Especially against measures that the current cabinet
despite its outgoing state are still taking, according to him. "Those are going to cost a farm 50,000 euros in
a year." There are also plans to march with many farmers from different countries to Brussels
steaming up, on June 4, two days before the European elections. "That's where we're going to make ourselves heard."
