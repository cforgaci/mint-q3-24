European Commission already decided to roll back unpopular measures, including
 in the area of nature conservation. On Tuesday, another major knee-jerk

It raises the question whether the commission is still able to do what it is on
Earth: acting in the European interest. Commission President Von der Leyen
seems to have her head rather with the European elections in June, and with her
European People's Party (EPP). The European Christian Democrats see themselves as
guardians of the peasant interest, but polls do not provide sufficient assurance that
they can maintain that role, due to the rise of the radical right and of new
(peasant) parties. And so it rains concessions, while the current European
agricultural policy really needs a shake-up. Nowhere is this more evident than in
Netherlands, where industrial, intensive livestock farming in particular weighs heavily on
society and causes a chain reaction of problems. The
nitrogen problems lead to problems in construction, at a time of great
housing shortage. The pollution of water and soil makes the Netherlands less livable.
A popular analysis reads: the agricultural reforms in the Green Deal are not
realistic, and therefore it is good that the ambitions are somewhat lowered. But once upon a time
 those ambitions were more realistic. Through endless procrastination, they have become unrealistic

want to implement them, so the problems are now much bigger and the solutions are
indeed much more radical. MP and former dairy farmer Harm Holman (NSC)
had the courage last week to call for a smaller livestock, because this would

but which immediately brought him serious threats. Well-intentioned
farmers who are willing to help think of solutions deserve every support.
support. That happens far too little, and unfortunately Von der Leyen is now setting a bad
example, by listening too much to farmers blocking highways and choosing a
road that has turned out to be a dead end for the Netherlands: that of postponement.

Last week a rule went on hold to promote biodiversity:
farmers would be required this year - for the first time, after earlier postponements - to set aside 4
percent of their farmland to be left fallow. On Tuesday, Von der
Leyen withdrew an entire bill, which was supposed to lead to halving the use of
pesticides should have resulted. An unusual move: the Commission
almost never withdraws proposals, in order to keep open the possibility of further
negotiations open.
 That road is now closed, despite overwhelming evidence that pesticides
can be harmful, not least to farmers themselves. Von der Leyen
defends the decision, arguing that the pesticides law, which was already
