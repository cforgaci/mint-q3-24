 39-year-old man from Klarenbeek and a 35-year-old man from Eerbeek, do have to
report to the probation service.
The prosecutor wanted the farmers, who were arrested in violent
farmer protests, would be detained longer. The public prosecutor and
police agreed last Wednesday that they will take stricter action
against violent and illegal protesters.

Tensions
The detention of the two farmers led to rising tensions in the
region. The mayor of Apeldoorn, Ton Heerts, saw himself Wednesday night
forced to issue an emergency order for the entire municipality. With that order
the police can act against rioters, close roads, evacuate places
and prohibit gatherings. People who do not cooperate can be
detained. The special order was deemed necessary because the
police determined through chat groups of farmers on social media channels that a
storming of the Apeldoorn headquarters was being planned. That
liberation action did not materialize.
 Lawyer Pieter Pel from Hattem, who is assisting the 39-year-old suspected farmer, said the
farmers were released because they both have busy dairy farms to
run. "My client works seventy to eighty hours a week and also his wife
has a job to keep his head above water. There is a very
young business at risk if you keep this man any longer."
Because "the action was in the neighborhood," according to his lawyer, the accused farmer had
found the time despite busy work to Monday night
to block a highway. "The police do speak of coordinated actions, but
my client was simply called into an app group and also didn't know what he got into
got into. It's not all that well-oiled".
