He\npoints to the plot edges that he has demarcated with a kilometer of \"wood edges and\nhawthorn hedges.\" Looks nice, and the plantings serve as a buffer\nagainst overflowing pesticides and fertilizer from a neighbor who is not like him\norganic farming. Further along, he dug two ponds. All kinds of reeds now grow around them.\nDevreese believes: your farm should exude the same quality as your product. So when he\n35 years ago he took over the farm of a retired couple in the West Flemish coastal village of De\nHaan, he first started to beautify the place. Until then, in the wide\nsurrounding area was nothing but grassland. Over the years, an area of ten hectares\nlarge where species thrived. The farm continued to grow. Initially\nDevreese had thirty goats; now there are three hundred. They graze in semi-open stalls.\nBecause Devreese has an organic farm, he is not allowed to close off his stables from the\noutside. That couldn't hurt, he thought, because goat farm 't Reigershof\nis not near a protected nature reserve. But when he recently used an\nonline calculation tool of the Flemish government to look at his \"mpact score,\" he got the\nscare of his life.\nIt turned out that the piece of land he created himself had been designated, without his knowledge, as\na so-called \"search zone. That is an area that the Flemish government keeps in option\nfor the realization of a protection area in the future, should it be necessary to\nhttps://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/06/29/als-mijn-weiland-beschermd-gebied-wordt-valt-alles-in-duigen-a4134986 2/7\n 12/5/22, 12:43 PM 'A matter of time before massive protests against the nitrogen policy arise in Flanders as well' - NRC\nachieve nitrogen targets. \"Apparently people have been on my land who have\nseen certain grasses and species that are not there elsewhere,\" says Devreese\nindignant. \"All of a sudden we are less than a kilometer from a nature reserve\nthat only got there because of our way of farming. If this is officially designated as a\nprotected area, we may have to go back to two hundred\ngoats. Then everything will fall apart?\" Because with a third loss of revenue, his farm is no longer\nno longer profitable.\nUncertain future\nRenaat Devreese is not the only farmer in Flanders with his hands in his pockets.\nSince the Flemish government issued a final version of the\nProgrammatic Approach to Nitrogen (PAS) reached agreements that some sectors\n(chickens, pigs) require a nitrogen reduction of 60 percent by 2030, the future\nof thousands of farmers is uncertain. As in the Netherlands, Flemish farmers are therefore taking to the\nthe streets to protest the nitrogen policy. This Wednesday evening, a\nlarge demonstration planned along several highways (although Belgian farmers\nare not planning to block those highways themselves for now). The Flemish farmers\nalso want to use their action to show Dutch farmers that they \"are not alone.\"\nthey report in a press release.\nAlso read this article about\nprevious farmers' protests in Brussels\nAs in the Netherlands, the Flemish government has also been working on a PAS for years. The Netherlands and\nBelgium are the undisputed leaders in that order when it comes to nitrogen emissions.\nNowhere else is so much livestock kept in such a small area. Agriculture is\nresponsible for over 53 percent of total nitrogen emissions in Flanders -\nnitrogen oxides and ammonia.\nResearch has shown that both Dutch and Flemish nature are in a state of excessive\nhigh nitrogen precipitation is causing respiratory distress. The Flemish Environment Agency calculated that\nat 80 percent of the protected nature areas in Flanders the critical\nthreshold has been exceeded. In only three of the 64 areas is the situation favorable.\nhttps://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2022/06/29/als-mijn-weiland-beschermd-gebied-wordt-valt-alles-in-duigen-a4134986 3/7\n 12/5/22, 12:43 PM 'A matter of time before massive protests against nitrogen policy arise in Flanders as well' - NRC\nLetter on the mat\nAlready in 2015, farms in Flanders received a letter on the doormat stating their\nimpact score on nearby nature reserves was stated. Colors were used\nworked with colors; with a green letter, up to 5 percent impact, a farmer could expand, with orange -\nup to 50 percent - expansion was impossible. And farmers who were 50 percent or more\nwere responsible for nitrogen impacts on a natural area, once a permit had\nexpiration of a permit, no new one would be granted.\nWith a green letter in his hand, Gunter Klaasen (43) therefore dared in 2015\nto give up his well-paying job in ict, get rid of his self-built house and\nand, together with his wife Daisy, took over his father's farm.\nHe became the fourth generation of Klaasen to run a farm on the Arendonksesteenweg in Ravels, near\nthe border with the Netherlands, to farm. Green meant permission\nto expand, so Klaasen took out a 2 million euro loan to build two new\nbarns. In the roof, he had a costly low ammonia emission system\nin the roof. Despite tens of thousands of extra chickens - he now has 124,000 - his\nnitrogen emissions did not go up as a result.\nAt home at the kitchen table, Klaasen, dressed in\na black shirt with \"RED THE BOER\" on his chest,\nthe permit for the expansion, while\nDaisy stands behind him cooking rice with chicken\nfrying. The last letter was dated January 2020.\nIt took more than a year, but then there were\ntwo brand new stalls next to two old\ncopies. The stables were barely in\nin use when the nitrogen problem in\nFlanders gained momentum.\nA chicken barn near Hasselt was\nno permit to expand after a\nnature organization successfully\nchallenged.

More\nthan a hundred orange farmers are being offered a way out with a buyout scheme. Especially\nthe area where Gunter Klaasen lives and works is a nitrogen hotspot.\nThe new PAS will also make it virtually\nimpossible to expand. The threshold for ammonia emissions is so low that almost all\nfarms will either have to make investments to drastically\ndown, or have to significantly reduce the amount of livestock before 2030.\nFor example, the number of pigs, nearly 6 million in Flanders, must be reduced by 30\npercent by 2030, for example.\nFlanders is allocating 3.6 billion euros to pay for the nitrogen dossier. In the Netherlands,\nthree times as big, it is 25 billion. The big difference between the two nitrogen agreements\nis, according to David De Pue, researcher at the Flemish Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries\nand Food Research, that in the Netherlands \"area-oriented thinking is used, rather than\nper farm\". De Pue sees that the Netherlands also immediately wants to address soil and groundwater quality\nwant to address. That comes later in Flanders.\nIn April, a fuss arose all the way to the Flemish parliament, when it appeared that companies\nhad ended up on the red list that were not yet red in 2015.

He felt it was his\nduty. On the way, except for one middle finger, he encountered only clapping people,\nhe says. He fills up when he thinks back to the \"Dutch collegiality.\" \"In\nFlanders we do not yet realize what is hanging over our heads. In the Netherlands we do\" He\nthinks this is because of the BoerBurger Movement and \"more objective media.\" In Flanders\nhe believes the farmer is portrayed as the big bad. If he had\nhad known this in advance, he would never have become a farmer seven years ago.\nKlaasen recently joined a steering committee with which he prepares protest actions.
